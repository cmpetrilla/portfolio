			<p class="c-content-paragraph">I'm a front-end engineer living in Brooklyn, New York City. I have six years of professional experience, but my personal interest in Web development began in 1997 with a fan page on GeoCities&mdash;embarrassing in retrospect, but I can't ignore my roots!</p>
			<p class="c-content-paragraph">Currently, I work as a remote software engineer with Elsevier, a medical publishing company. I've been with Elsevier for about four years, and during that time, I've progressed from a junior- to senior-level role.</p>
			<p class="c-content-paragraph">Before Elsevier, I worked with the University of Delaware as a Web developer. I focused on building interactive Web applications, but my role also included requirements gathering, QA, and some project management.</p>
			<p class="c-content-paragraph">I love development, but I find it important to round that out with other interests. For me, that includes watching movies, reading (especially gothic fiction), learning photography, and experiencing Japanese food and language. I also love whiskey!</p>
